# Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Company

This project explores customer churn in a telecom company to identify patterns, key drivers, and actionable insights that can help reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## Project Overview

Customer churn, the loss of clients or subscribers is a critical challenge in the telecom industry. By analyzing historical customer data, this project aims to answer key questions:

* Which customers are most likely to churn?
* At what point they're likely to leave
* How can the company proactively retain customers?

## Approach

* **Data Exploration:** Cleaned and analyzed customer demographics, subscription plans, usage metrics, and support interactions.
* **Visualization:** Created charts and graphs to understand trends, distributions, and correlations with churn.
* **Insights & Recommendations:** Identified high-risk customer segments and suggested targeted retention strategies.

## Key Insights

* Customers on month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn than long-term contract holders.
* Early stage(0-6months) customers are likely to churn more.
* Certain usage patterns, such as low engagement with value-added services, indicate increased churn risk.
